## 1. Introduction  
This report details the enhancements made to the Ascent Physiotherapy website, originally developed using HTML and CSS for the DGL 103 final project. The initial site was functional but static, lacking interactivity. To improve user experience and functionality, JavaScript was integrated to add a dynamic appointment booking system, a product and service filter/search feature with a price range filter, and interactive team member profiles. This document outlines the background, implemented features, technical approaches, testing outcomes, and personal insights gained during the process.

## 2. Website Background Information  
The Ascent Physiotherapy website was created as a digital platform for a fictional physiotherapy clinic in Comox, BC. Initially built with HTML5 and styled with CSS3, it included pages such as Home (`index.html`), Appointment Booking (`appointment.html`), Products & Services (`products.html`), Our Team (`team.html`), and Contact Us (`contactus.html`). While the site provided essential information, it lacked dynamic features to engage users effectively. This enhancement project leverages JavaScript (`app.js`) to introduce interactivity, making the site more modern and user-friendly.

## 3. Features Added and Their Enhancements  

### 3.1 Dynamic Appointment Booking System  
- **Description:** The `appointment.html` page now features a real-time form with validation, a searchable service/product dropdown with sorting, and a confirmation modal. Users can select multiple services/products, see a total price, and confirm bookings via a pop-up displaying their details (e.g., Name, Email, Date, Services). Error messages appear instantly for invalid inputs, and selected items persist in a dynamic display.  
- **Enhancement:** This system simplifies booking by providing immediate feedback, reducing errors, and offering a clear confirmation step. The dropdown and multi-selection feature allow users to customize their appointments efficiently, enhancing usability and engagement.  

### 3.2 Dynamic Product and Service Filter/Search Feature  
- **Description:** The `products.html` page includes a real-time search bar, category filter (All, Services, Equipment, Products), sort options (Default, Low-to-High, High-to-Low), and a price range filter (Min/Max inputs). Services and products are displayed in tables, dynamically filtered and sorted based on user input.  
- **Enhancement:** This feature improves navigation by enabling users to quickly find items by name, category, or price range. The price filter caters to budget preferences, while real-time updates enhance responsiveness, making the page more practical and user-centric.  

### 3.3 Interactive Team Member Profiles  
- **Description:** The `team.html` page now features collapsible team profiles with a "Read More" button (`collapsible`). Clicking a button expands the biography with a smooth animation, while collapsing other open sections (accordion-style).  
- **Enhancement:** This compact design reduces clutter, allowing users to explore team details selectively. The smooth animations improve visual appeal, and the accordion functionality enhances navigation by focusing attention on one profile at a time.

## 4. JavaScript Techniques Used  
- **Dynamic Appointment Booking System:**  
  - `addEventListener('input')` and debouncing (`setTimeout`) for real-time dropdown filtering on `serviceInput`.  
  - Array methods (`filter`, `sort`) to dynamically populate `serviceDropdown` based on search and `sortService` value.  
  - DOM manipulation (`createElement`, `appendChild`) to display selected items in `selectedItemsDiv` and update `servicePrice`.  
  - Form validation with regex (e.g., email, phone) and date checks (`new Date`), showing errors via `showError`.  
  - Modal display (`style.display = 'flex'`) with dynamic content updates using `textContent`.  

- **Dynamic Product and Service Filter/Search Feature:**  
  - `filter()` and `sort()` on table rows (`tr`) based on `searchInput`, `categoryFilter`, `sortFilter`, and price inputs (`minPrice`, `maxPrice`).  
  - Event listeners (`input`, `change`) for real-time updates without page reloads.  
  - Cloning original table rows (`cloneNode`) to preserve default order and reapply filters dynamically.  
  - Price parsing (`parseFloat`) and dataset attributes (`data-price`) for accurate filtering and sorting.  

- **Interactive Team Member Profiles:**  
  - `classList.toggle('active')` to manage collapsible state.  
  - `style.maxHeight` with `scrollHeight` for smooth expansion/collapse animations, paired with CSS transitions.  
  - Loop through `collapsibles` to collapse other sections, implementing accordion behavior.  

- **Additional Techniques:**  
  - Mobile navigation toggle using `classList.toggle('show-items')` and `style.width`.  
  - Strict mode (`"use strict"`) for cleaner, safer code execution.

## 5. HTML and CSS Validation and Browser Testing Results  
- **HTML Validation:** Validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. Minor warnings (e.g., duplicate Cloudflare scripts) were noted but not critical. All pages passed after ensuring proper nesting and attributes (e.g., `alt` on images).  
- **CSS Validation:** Checked with the W3C CSS Validation Service. One error (unclosed media query brace) was fixed in `style.css`. Post-correction, the CSS was fully compliant with CSS3 standards.  
- **Browser Testing:** Tested on Chrome, Firefox:  
  - **Chrome/Firefox:** All features (modal, filters, collapsibles) worked seamlessly.

## 6. Project Work Experience  

### 6.1 Knowledge and Skills Acquired  
- Proficiency in JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and array methods.  
- Experience with real-time form validation and dynamic UI updates.  
- Improved CSS animation skills, integrating transitions with JavaScript.  
- Understanding of responsive design principles and cross-browser compatibility.  

### 6.2 Time Spent on Implementation  
- Total: Approximately 28 hours over two weeks.  
  - Appointment Booking System: 10 hours (dropdown, validation, modal).  
  - Product/Service Filter: 12 hours (search, sort, price range logic).  
  - Team Profiles: 4 hours (collapsible logic, animations).  
  - Testing and Validation: 2 hours.  

### 6.3 Challenges Encountered  
- Syncing `serviceInput` dropdown with manual entry required debouncing to avoid lag.  
- Price range filtering in `products.html` needed careful handling of empty or invalid inputs.  
- Ensuring consistent animation timing across browsers for `team.html` collapsibles was tricky.  

### 6.4 Lessons Learned  
- Debouncing user input improves performance in real-time features.  
- Testing early and often across browsers prevents late-stage fixes.  
- Clear variable naming (e.g., `selectedItems`) enhances code readability.  

### 6.5 Suggestions for Future Improvements  
- Integrate LocalStorage to persist appointment form data, as initially planned.  
- Add Google Maps API to `contactus.html` for an interactive map beyond the iframe.  
- Implement backend integration (e.g., Node.js) for email confirmations and data storage.

## 7. Conclusion  
The Ascent Physiotherapy website now offers a significantly enhanced user experience through JavaScript-driven interactivity. The appointment booking system streamlines scheduling, the product/service filter improves navigation, and the team profiles provide a polished, user-friendly design. This project honed my web development skills and highlighted the importance of iterative testing and user-focused design. Future enhancements could further elevate functionality with persistent storage and backend features.
